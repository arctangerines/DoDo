WARNING: THIS IS A MESS RIGHT NOW, THAT'S HOW MY EARLY PROCESS LOOKS ALWAYS

# DoDo

ToDo manager

# Short term goals
* List TODOs in a project
* Would be cool to add an option to print some lines before/after
* Dump TODOs (same as list?)


# Long term goals

* Implement config file parser
* Interactive mode, show TODOs in a project in an interactive reader (kinda
  like diff)
